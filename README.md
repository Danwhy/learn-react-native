# learn-react-native

A collection of examples/guides to using React-Native.

[Counter](https://github.com/Danwhy/learn-react-native/tree/master/counter) - React Native basics.  
[Navigator] (https://github.com/Danwhy/learn-react-native/tree/master/navigator) - The basics of using the Navigator component.  
[Panhandler] (https://github.com/Danwhy/learn-react-native/tree/master/panhandling) - The basics of gestures and the panResponder.

To run these examples, clone the repo, open the `.xcodeproj` files in xcode, and press the 'run' button.  
If this doesn't work for you, you may need to run `npm install` inside the example's directory to install react-native locally. Then run `npm run start` to start the react packager, and try the above again.
